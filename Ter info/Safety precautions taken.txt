1. Use Rate Limiting & IP Throttling

Helps prevent spam and abuse without needing user accounts.

Tools like Express Rate Limit can be used to limit requests from a single IP.

OKAY


2. Input Sanitization & Validation

Always clean and validate input before saving to the database.

Use libraries like express-validator to prevent SQL injection or script attacks.

OKAY


3. Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements)

You’re using SQLite, which supports this easily.

Ensures safe database operations without raw string interpolation.

OKAY

4. Store Posts with Metadata (Optional)

You can store things like timestamp, IP hash, or browser fingerprint anonymously.

Helps detect abuse or coordinate moderation without revealing identities.

Too much additional info i don't understand


5. Use CAPTCHA or Honeypot Fields

Simple way to stop bots while keeping users anonymous.

Google reCAPTCHA or hidden honeypot fields can reduce spam drastically.

Okay only added a Honeypot trap


6. Database File Permissions

Make sure your posts.db file is not exposed to the public.

Only your server-side code should access it; lock down filesystem permissions.


7. Backups + Encryption

Use automated encrypted backups just in case something goes sideways.

Optionally encrypt content at rest for an extra layer of protection.

8.Crowd control
Add a “flagged” column to your table so you can mark but not immediately delete comments for review:

sql ALTER TABLE compliments ADD COLUMN flagged INTEGER DEFAULT 0;

let users “report” mean compliments for review — poetic justice via crowdsourced kindness!
