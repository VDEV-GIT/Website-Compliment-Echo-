Absolutely — file permissions are your silent guardians when it comes to protecting posts.db from prying eyes. Here’s how to fortify it properly, whether you're deploying locally or preparing for production:

🔒 Basic File Permission Rules
On Windows (NTFS):

Place posts.db outside your public directory (avoid /public or /views).

Ensure only the user running your server app has read/write access.

Right-click the file → Properties → Security tab → restrict access from other users.

On Linux/macOS: Use the terminal to restrict permissions:

bash
# Only owner can read/write
chmod 600 posts.db

# Optionally, make owner-only directory
mkdir secure_db && mv posts.db secure_db/
chmod 700 secure_db
✅ This blocks other users/processes from reading or modifying the file unless explicitly allowed.

🌐 Prevent Web Access
Even if you're careful with filesystem permissions, web servers like Express shouldn't expose static access to sensitive files.

Double-check that you're only serving static assets from safe paths:

js
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public'))); // ✅ good
Avoid serving entire directories (like __dirname) which might accidentally expose posts.db.

🧠 Pro Tips
Use .gitignore to avoid uploading your database file:

bash
posts.db
Never hardcode or log the file path in a way it shows in the browser.

For production, consider moving to a hosted database and limiting IP or credential access entirely.
